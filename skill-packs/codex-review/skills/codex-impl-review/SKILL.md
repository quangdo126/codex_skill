# Codex Implementation Review

## Purpose
Use this skill to run adversarial review on uncommitted changes before commit.

## Prerequisites
- Working tree has staged or unstaged changes.
- `codex` CLI is installed and authenticated.
- `codex-review` skill pack is installed (global or project scope).

## Runner Resolution
Resolve the shared Node.js runner from project-local scope first, then global scope:

```bash
if [ -n "${CODEX_RUNNER:-}" ] && [ -f "$CODEX_RUNNER" ]; then
  RUNNER="$CODEX_RUNNER"
else
  RUNNER=""
  SEARCH_DIR="$PWD"
  while [ "$SEARCH_DIR" != "/" ]; do
    CANDIDATE="$SEARCH_DIR/.claude/skills/codex-review/scripts/codex-runner.js"
    if [ -f "$CANDIDATE" ]; then RUNNER="$CANDIDATE"; break; fi
    SEARCH_DIR=$(dirname "$SEARCH_DIR")
  done
  [ -z "$RUNNER" ] && [ -f "$HOME/.claude/skills/codex-review/scripts/codex-runner.js" ] && \
    RUNNER="$HOME/.claude/skills/codex-review/scripts/codex-runner.js"
fi
[ -z "$RUNNER" ] && { echo "Install: npx codex-skill init -g" >&2; exit 1; }
```

## Workflow
1. Gather diff context (`git status`, `git diff`, optional plan file).
2. Build prompt from `references/prompts.md` (`Implementation Review Prompt`).
3. Start round 1 with `node "$RUNNER" start --working-dir "$PWD" --effort "$EFFORT"`.
4. Poll via `node "$RUNNER" poll <STATE_DIR>` every ~15 seconds.
5. Parse issue list with `references/output-format.md`.
6. Fix valid issues in code; rebut invalid findings with evidence.
7. Resume debate via `--thread-id` until `APPROVE` or stalemate.
8. Return final review summary and unresolved risks.

## Required References
- Detailed execution: `references/workflow.md`
- Prompt templates: `references/prompts.md`
- Output contract: `references/output-format.md`

## Rules
- Codex reviews only; it does not edit files.
- Preserve functional intent unless fix requires behavior change.
- Every accepted issue must map to a concrete code diff.
- If stalemate persists, present both sides and defer to user.
