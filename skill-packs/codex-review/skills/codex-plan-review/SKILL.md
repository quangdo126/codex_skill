description: Debate implementation plans between Claude Code and Codex CLI before coding. Use this skill after a plan file exists; Claude and Codex iterate until consensus or explicit stalemate.

# Codex Plan Review

## Purpose
Use this skill to adversarially review a plan before implementation starts.

## When to Use
Use **after creating a plan** but **before implementing code**.

Typical workflow:
1. Create plan (plan.md) → 2. `/codex-plan-review` → 3. Refine plan → 4. Implement → 5. `/codex-impl-review`

Not a substitute for code review. Reviews plan quality, not implementation.

## Prerequisites
- A Markdown plan file exists (e.g. `plan.md`) with headings for sections, steps, or phases.
- `codex` CLI is installed and authenticated.
- `codex-review` skill pack is installed (`npx github:lploc94/codex_skill`).

## Runner

```bash
RUNNER="{{RUNNER_PATH}}"
```

## Workflow
1. **Ask user** to choose debate effort level: `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `xhigh` (default: `high`). Ask output format: `markdown` (default), `json`, `sarif`, or `both`. Set `EFFORT` and `FORMAT`.
2. Run pre-flight checks (see `references/workflow.md` §1.5).
3. Build prompt from `references/prompts.md` (`Plan Review Prompt`), following the Placeholder Injection Guide.
4. Start round 1 with `node "$RUNNER" start --working-dir "$PWD" --effort "$EFFORT" --format "$FORMAT"`.
5. Poll with adaptive intervals (Round 1: 60s/60s/30s/15s..., Round 2+: 30s/15s...). After each poll, report **specific activities** from poll output (e.g. which files Codex is reading, what topic it is analyzing). See `references/workflow.md` for parsing guide. NEVER report generic "Codex is running" — always extract concrete details.
6. Parse Codex issues (`ISSUE-{N}` + `VERDICT`) using `references/output-format.md`.
7. Apply valid fixes to the plan, **save the plan file**, rebut invalid points, and resume with `--thread-id`.
8. Repeat until `APPROVE`, stalemate, or hard cap (5 rounds).
9. Return final debate summary, residual risks, and final plan path.

### Effort Level Guide
| Level    | Depth             | Best for                        | Typical time |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------------------|-------------|
| `low`    | Surface check     | Quick sanity check              | ~2-3 min |
| `medium` | Standard review   | Most day-to-day work            | ~5-8 min |
| `high`   | Deep analysis     | Important features              | ~10-15 min |
| `xhigh`  | Exhaustive        | Critical/security-sensitive     | ~20-30 min |

### Output Format Guide
| Format     | Output Files                          | Best for                        |
|------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `markdown` | `review.md` (human-readable)          | Default, interactive review     |
| `json`     | `review.md` + `review.json`           | CI/CD integration, automation   |
| `sarif`    | `review.md` + `review.sarif.json`     | IDE integration (VS Code, etc.) |
| `both`     | `review.md` + `review.json` + `review.sarif.json` | Complete documentation          |

**Note**: `review.md` is always written as the primary markdown output.

- Detailed execution steps: `references/workflow.md`
- Prompt templates: `references/prompts.md`
- Output contract: `references/output-format.md`

## Rules
- If Claude Code plan mode is active, stay in plan mode during the debate. Otherwise, operate normally.
- Do not implement code in this skill.
- Do not claim consensus without explicit `VERDICT: APPROVE` or user-accepted stalemate.
- Preserve traceability: each accepted issue maps to a concrete plan edit.
