# Codex Codebase Review

## Purpose
Review large codebases (50-500+ files) that exceed single-session context limits. Splits codebase into module-based chunks, reviews each in an independent Codex session, then Claude synthesizes cross-cutting findings across modules.

## Prerequisites
- Source files in working directory.
- `codex` CLI is installed and authenticated.
- `codex-review` skill pack is installed (`npx github:lploc94/codex_skill`).

## Runner

```bash
RUNNER="{{RUNNER_PATH}}"
```

## Workflow
1. **Collect inputs**: effort level, parallel factor, focus areas, output format (`markdown` default, `json`, `sarif`, or `both`).
2. **Discovery**: detect project type, list source files, identify module boundaries.
3. **Chunking**: group files into 500-2000 line chunks, present chunk plan.
4. **Review loop**: for each chunk — build prompt, `node "$RUNNER" start --format "$FORMAT"`, poll, parse ISSUE-{N}, propagate context.
5. **Cross-cutting analysis**: Claude synthesizes all chunk findings — inconsistencies, API contracts, DRY violations, integration, architecture.
6. **Validation** (effort >= high): feed CROSS-{N} findings to Codex for verification.
7. **Final report**: overview table, per-module findings, cross-cutting findings, action items.
8. **Cleanup**: stop ALL tracked STATE_DIRs — always runs regardless of outcome.

### Effort Level Guide
| Level    | Discovery        | Cross-cutting    | Validation   |
|----------|------------------|------------------|--------------|
| `low`    | Auto-detect only | Basic (2 cats)   | Skip         |
| `medium` | Auto + confirm   | Standard (3 cats)| Skip         |
| `high`   | Full + confirm   | Full (5 cats)    | 1 round      |
| `xhigh`  | Full + suggest   | Full + arch      | 2 rounds     |

### Output Format Guide
| Format     | Output Files                          | Best for                        |
|------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `markdown` | `review.md` (human-readable)          | Default, interactive review     |
| `json`     | `review.md` + `review.json`           | CI/CD integration, automation   |
| `sarif`    | `review.md` + `review.sarif.json`     | IDE integration (VS Code, etc.) |
| `both`     | `review.md` + `review.json` + `review.sarif.json` | Complete documentation          |

**Note**: `review.md` is always written as the primary markdown output. Each chunk produces separate output files in its STATE_DIR.

## Required References
- Detailed orchestration: `references/workflow.md`
- Prompt templates: `references/prompts.md`
- Output contract: `references/output-format.md`

## Rules
- Codex reviews only; it does not edit files.
- No cross-contamination between chunk sessions — each chunk is independent.
- Context propagation: only high/critical findings from prior chunks, capped at ~2000 tokens.
- Cleanup always runs — stop every tracked STATE_DIR regardless of outcome.
- Scope is full codebase only — for diff review use `/codex-impl-review`.
