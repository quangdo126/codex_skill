| `{BASE_BRANCH}` | Validated base branch (see SKILL.md §1) | Yes | — |
| `{COMMIT_COUNT}` | Number of commits: `git rev-list --count {BASE_BRANCH}..HEAD` | Yes | — |
| `{COMMIT_LIST}` | Formatted list: `<SHA> <subject>` per commit from `git log {BASE_BRANCH}..HEAD --oneline` | Yes | — |
| `{USER_REQUEST}` | User's task/request description | No | "Review this PR for quality and merge readiness" |
| `{SESSION_CONTEXT}` | Structured context block (see schema below) | No | "Not specified" |
| `{OUTPUT_FORMAT}` | Copy entire fenced code block from `references/output-format.md` | Yes | — |

### Round 2+ additional placeholders

| Placeholder | Source | Required | Default |
|-------------|--------|----------|---------|
| `{AGREED_POINTS}` | Findings both Claude and Codex agree on (merged descriptions) | Yes | — |
| `{DISAGREED_POINTS}` | Findings where Claude and Codex disagree (both positions) | Yes | — |
| `{NEW_FINDINGS}` | Claude-only or Codex-only findings not yet discussed | Yes | — |
| `{CONTINUE_OR_CONSENSUS_OR_STALEMATE}` | Current debate status with reasoning | Yes | — |

### SESSION_CONTEXT Schema

When user provides context or Claude can infer it, format as:

```
Constraints: {e.g. "team requires PR approval from 2 reviewers"}
Assumptions: {e.g. "this is a feature branch targeting main"}
Tech stack: {languages, frameworks}
Acceptance criteria: {what defines a good PR for this project}
Review scope: {branch diff + commit history + PR metadata}
```

## PR Review Prompt (Round 1)
```
## Your Role
You are Codex acting as an equal peer reviewer of a pull request. Another reviewer (Claude) is independently analyzing the same PR — you will debate afterward.

## PR Information
- Title: {PR_TITLE}
- Description: {PR_DESCRIPTION}
- Base branch: {BASE_BRANCH}
- Commits: {COMMIT_COUNT}

## Commits in Scope
{COMMIT_LIST}

## How to Inspect Changes
- Read the branch diff: `git diff {BASE_BRANCH}...HEAD`.
- Read the commit log: `git log {BASE_BRANCH}..HEAD --oneline`.
- For individual commits: `git show <SHA>`.
- Review file stats: `git diff {BASE_BRANCH}...HEAD --stat`.

## User's Original Request
{USER_REQUEST}

## Session Context
{SESSION_CONTEXT}

## Instructions
1. Review code: correctness, regressions, edge cases, security, performance, maintainability.
2. Review PR-level: description accuracy, commit hygiene, scope appropriateness.
3. Do NOT suggest fixes — focus on identifying problems and their impact.
4. Never edit files or run git add/commit/rebase/reset — use read-only inspection commands only.
5. In File field, use specific file path and line range for code findings, or "PR-level" for non-code findings.
6. In Evidence field, reference specific diff hunks, code snippets, or PR metadata.
7. Use EXACT output format below.

## Required Output Format
{OUTPUT_FORMAT}
```

## Claude Independent Analysis Prompt
```
## Your Task
You are reviewing a pull request independently. Codex is reviewing the same PR separately — you will NOT see their findings until later.

## INFORMATION BARRIER
- Do NOT read $SESSION_DIR/review.md or any Codex output.
- Form your OWN conclusions based on the diff, commits, and PR metadata.
- Commit to specific positions.

## PR Information
- Title: {PR_TITLE}
- Description: {PR_DESCRIPTION}
- Base branch: {BASE_BRANCH}
- Commits: {COMMIT_COUNT}

## Commits in Scope
{COMMIT_LIST}

## How to Inspect Changes
- Read the branch diff: `git diff {BASE_BRANCH}...HEAD`.
- Read the commit log: `git log {BASE_BRANCH}..HEAD --oneline`.
- For individual commits: `git show <SHA>`.
- Review file stats: `git diff {BASE_BRANCH}...HEAD --stat`.

## Instructions
1. Review code: correctness, regressions, edge cases, security, performance, maintainability.
2. Review PR-level: description accuracy, commit hygiene, scope appropriateness.
3. Do NOT suggest fixes — focus on identifying problems and their impact.
4. In File field, use specific file path and line range for code findings, or "PR-level" for non-code findings.
5. Assess merge readiness in your Pre-Assessment section.
6. Write in the required format below.

## Required Output Format
{CLAUDE_ANALYSIS_FORMAT}
```

## Response Prompt (Round 2+)
```
## Session Context
{SESSION_CONTEXT}

## PR Information
- Title: {PR_TITLE}
- Base branch: {BASE_BRANCH}
- Commits: {COMMIT_COUNT}

## Commits in Scope
{COMMIT_LIST}

## Points We Agree On
{AGREED_POINTS}

## Points We Disagree On
{DISAGREED_POINTS}

## New Findings
{NEW_FINDINGS}

## Current Status
{CONTINUE_OR_CONSENSUS_OR_STALEMATE}

## Instructions
1. Re-read the branch diff: `git diff {BASE_BRANCH}...HEAD`. For specific commits: `git show <SHA>`.
2. Address disagreements with evidence from the diff and code.
3. Do NOT suggest fixes — focus on whether the problem exists and its severity.
4. Never edit files or run git add/commit/rebase/reset — use read-only inspection commands only.
5. Keep ISSUE-{N} numbering stable. New findings use the next available number.
6. Use EXACT output format. You MUST include a VERDICT block.
7. Respond with RESPONSE-{N} blocks. End with VERDICT: `CONSENSUS` only if all disagreements resolved. `CONTINUE` if any point still disputed. `STALEMATE` only if you have no new evidence to add. Claude will send another round if you return CONTINUE.
