# Think-About Workflow

## 1) Inputs
- User question/topic.
- Scope and constraints.
- Relevant files or external facts.
- Reasoning effort level.

## 2) Start Round 1
```bash
STATE_OUTPUT=$(printf '%s' "$PROMPT" | node "$RUNNER" start --working-dir "$PWD" --effort "$EFFORT")
STATE_DIR=${STATE_OUTPUT#CODEX_STARTED:}
```

## 3) Poll

```bash
POLL_OUTPUT=$(node "$RUNNER" poll "$STATE_DIR")
```

Adaptive intervals — start slow, speed up:

**Round 1 (first review):**
- Poll 1: wait 60s
- Poll 2: wait 60s
- Poll 3: wait 30s
- Poll 4+: wait 15s

**Round 2+ (rebuttal rounds):**
- Poll 1: wait 30s
- Poll 2+: wait 15s

After each poll, report to user what Codex is doing (extract status lines from poll output).
Continue while status is `running`.
Stop on `completed|failed|timeout|stalled`.

## 4) Claude Response
After Codex output:
- List agreements.
- List disagreements and why.
- Add missing angles.
- Set status (`CONTINUE`, `CONSENSUS`, `STALEMATE`).

## 5) Resume Round 2+
```bash
STATE_OUTPUT=$(printf '%s' "$RESPONSE_PROMPT" | node "$RUNNER" start \
  --working-dir "$PWD" --thread-id "$THREAD_ID" --effort "$EFFORT")
```

## 6) Stop Conditions
- Consensus reached.
- Stalemate detected (repeated claims with no new evidence for two rounds).
- Hard cap reached.

## 7) Final User Output
- Key insights.
- Recommendations.
- Remaining disagreements.
- Confidence level.
