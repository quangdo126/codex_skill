description: Peer debate between Claude Code and Codex on any technical question. Both sides think independently, challenge each other, and converge to consensus or explicit disagreement.

# Codex Think About

## Purpose
Use this skill for peer reasoning, not code review. Claude and Codex are equal thinkers.

## Prerequisites
- A clear question or decision topic from the user.
- `codex` CLI installed and authenticated.
- `codex-review` skill pack is installed (`npx github:lploc94/codex_skill`).

## Runner

```bash
RUNNER="{{RUNNER_PATH}}"
```

## Workflow
1. **Ask user** to choose reasoning effort level: `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `xhigh` (default: `high`). Gather factual context only (no premature opinion). Ask output format: `markdown` (default), `json`, `sarif`, or `both`. Set `EFFORT` and `FORMAT`.
2. Build round-1 prompt from `references/prompts.md`.
3. Start Codex thread with `node "$RUNNER" start --working-dir "$PWD" --effort "$EFFORT" --format "$FORMAT"`.
4. Poll with adaptive intervals (Round 1: 60s/60s/30s/15s..., Round 2+: 30s/15s...). After each poll, report **specific activities** from poll output (e.g. which files Codex is reading, what topic it is analyzing). See `references/workflow.md` for parsing guide. NEVER report generic "Codex is running" — always extract concrete details.
5. Claude responds with agree/disagree points and new perspectives.
6. Resume via `--thread-id` and loop until consensus or stalemate.
7. Present user-facing synthesis with agreements, disagreements, and confidence.

### Effort Level Guide
| Level    | Depth             | Best for                        |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| `low`    | Surface check     | Quick sanity check              |
| `medium` | Standard review   | Most day-to-day work            |
| `high`   | Deep analysis     | Important features              |
| `xhigh`  | Exhaustive        | Critical/security-sensitive     |

### Output Format Guide
| Format     | Output Files                          | Best for                        |
|------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `markdown` | `review.md` (human-readable)          | Default, interactive debate     |
| `json`     | `review.md` + `review.json`           | Structured reasoning output     |
| `sarif`    | `review.md` + `review.sarif.json`     | Not recommended for think-about |
| `both`     | `review.md` + `review.json` + `review.sarif.json` | Complete documentation          |

**Note**: `review.md` is always written as the primary markdown output. SARIF format is less useful for think-about (no code locations), prefer JSON for structured output.

## Required References
- Execution loop: `references/workflow.md`
- Prompt templates: `references/prompts.md`
- Output contract: `references/output-format.md`

## Rules
- Keep roles as peers; no reviewer/implementer framing.
- Separate facts from opinions.
- Detect stalemate when arguments repeat with no new evidence.
- End with clear recommendations and open questions.
