description: Peer debate between Claude Code and Codex on any technical question. Both think independently, challenge each other, converge to consensus or explicit disagreement.

# Codex Think About

## Purpose
Peer reasoning, not code review. Claude and Codex are equal analytical peers.

## When to Use
Debate technical decisions or design questions before implementing. Architecture choices, technology comparisons, reasoning through tradeoffs.

## Prerequisites
- A question or decision topic from the user.

## Runner
RUNNER="{{RUNNER_PATH}}"
SKILLS_DIR="{{SKILLS_DIR}}"
json_esc() { printf '%s' "$1" | node -e 'let d="";process.stdin.on("data",c=>d+=c);process.stdin.on("end",()=>process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify(d)))'; }

## Critical Rules (DO NOT skip)
- Stdin: `printf '%s' "$PROMPT" | node "$RUNNER" ...` -- NEVER `echo`. JSON via heredoc.
- Validate: `init` output must start with `CODEX_SESSION:`. `start`/`resume` must return valid JSON. `CODEX_NOT_FOUND`->tell user install codex.
- `status === "completed"` means **Codex's turn is done** -- NOT that the debate is over. MUST check Loop Decision table.
- Loop: Do NOT exit unless consensus or stalemate. No round cap.
- Errors: `failed`->retry once (re-poll 15s). `timeout`->report partial, suggest lower effort. `stalled`+recoverable->`stop`->recovery `resume`->poll; not recoverable->report partial. Cleanup sequencing: `finalize`+`stop` ONLY after recovery resolves.
- Cleanup: ALWAYS run `finalize` + `stop`, even on failure/timeout.
- Runner manages all session state -- NEVER read/write session files manually.
- **Information barrier**: Claude MUST complete independent analysis BEFORE reading Codex output.
- For poll intervals and detailed error flows -> `Read references/protocol.md`

## Workflow

### 1. Collect Inputs
Follow `references/question-sharpening.md`. Confirm rewrite if substantive. Gather effort (default `high`), scope, relevant files, project context. No premature opinion.

### 2. Init + Start Codex (Do NOT poll yet)
Init: `node "$RUNNER" init --skill-name codex-think-about --working-dir "$PWD"`
Render template=`round1`, placeholders: `QUESTION`, `PROJECT_CONTEXT`, `RELEVANT_FILES`, `CONSTRAINTS`.
Start: `printf '%s' "$PROMPT" | node "$RUNNER" start "$SESSION_DIR" --effort "$EFFORT" --sandbox danger-full-access`

### 3. Claude Independent Analysis (BEFORE polling)
**INFORMATION BARRIER**: MUST NOT read Codex output. Codex runs in background.
Render template=`claude-analysis`, same placeholders. Analyze using own knowledge. MAY use MCP tools (web_search, context7). Analysis must be COMPLETE and FINAL before Step 4.

### 4. Poll -> Cross-Analysis -> Resume Loop
Poll: `node "$RUNNER" poll "$SESSION_DIR"`. Report activities. (-> `references/protocol.md` for intervals)
Parse `review.insights`, `review.considerations`, `review.recommendations`, `review.sources`. Fallback: `review.raw_markdown`.
Classify: Genuine Agreement, Genuine Disagreement, Claude-only Insight, Codex-only Insight, Same Direction Different Depth.
Build response: Agreements, Disagreements (defend with evidence), New Perspectives, Source Cross-validation.

**File Modification Guard** (after each round):
**In git repo**: `BASELINE=$(git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all --ignored)` before round; compare after. New lines = Codex modified files.
**Outside git repo**: Snapshot files with `find`+`stat` before round; compare after. Classify added/deleted/modified by path+mtime.
**If changes detected**: STOP workflow immediately. List every modified/created/deleted file. Warn user: "Codex violated file modification rules." Do NOT auto-revert. Run cleanup. `danger-full-access` is for web research ONLY.

Render template=`round2+`, placeholders: `AGREED_POINTS`, `DISAGREED_POINTS`, `NEW_PERSPECTIVES`, `CONTINUE_OR_CONSENSUS_OR_STALEMATE`.
Resume: `printf '%s' "$PROMPT" | node "$RUNNER" resume "$SESSION_DIR" --effort "$EFFORT"`. Back to Poll.

| # | Condition | Action |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Both sides converged, no significant disagreements | EXIT -> step 5 |
| 2 | convergence.stalemate === true or same disagreements 2 rounds | EXIT -> step 5 (stalemate) |
| 3 | Significant disagreements remain or new perspectives | CONTINUE -> Cross-Analysis |

### 5. Completion + Output
Consensus -> done. Stalemate -> list deadlocked points, recommend which to favor, ask user.
Report: Consensus Points, Remaining Disagreements (Point|Claude|Codex), Recommendations, Consolidated Sources, Open Questions, Confidence Level.

### 6. Finalize + Cleanup
`finalize` + `stop`. Always run. (-> `references/protocol.md` for error handling)

## Flavor Text Triggers
SKILL_START, POLL_WAITING, CODEX_RETURNED, THINK_PEER, THINK_AGREE, THINK_DISAGREE, LATE_ROUND, APPROVE_VICTORY, STALEMATE_DRAW, FINAL_SUMMARY

## Rules
- Keep roles as peers; no reviewer/implementer framing.
- Codex MUST NOT modify project files. Codex MUST cite sources for web claims.
- Separate researched facts (with sources) from opinions.
